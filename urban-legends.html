					<p class="question">Because a Cadet is not supposed to move while at the position of <em>Parade Rest</em>, he/she can respond to no other command except for <em>Attention</em>.</p>
					<p class="response">While indeed the position of <em>Parade Rest</em> calls for immobility (AFMAN 36-2203, page 19, paragraph 3.3.1.1), the manual states earlier that if an improper command is given, members will execute the maneuver to the best of their ability (page 12, paragraph 2.2.5). So, if Cadets are at <em>Parade Rest</em> and the flight commander or flight sergeant incorrectly calls a movement other than <em>Attention</em>, the Cadets should come to attention and execute the movement to the best of their ability.</p>
				</article>
				<article>
					<p class="question">Cadets may not	drink Mountain Dew or Coffee while in uniform.</p>
					<p class="response">I initially believed there was a policy letter forbidding Cadets from consuming high-caffeine drinks such as Red Bull or Amp at Cadet Activities. This turns out to be untrue.</p>
				</article>
				<article>
					<p class="question">ONLY Cadet Officers and NCOs may wear the service dress coat.</p>
					<p class="response">This is an Urban Legend; Cadets	of any grade may wear the service dress coat. See CAPM 39-1 pages 17 and 25, Note 1 on both pages. Those notes specify: �1. Grade Insignia: Cadet officers wear regular size metal grade insignia on shoulder boards; cadet NCOs and Airmen wear a metal chevron on right lapel. By this statement, it is apparent that Cadets of all ranks may indeed wear the service coat. Now, what cadets MAY POSSIBLY be keying on is the statement in CAPM 39-1 (page 15, paragraph 2-1 b.) that only SENIOR MEMBER officers and SENIOR MEMBER NCOs are allowed to wear the mess dress uniform. The mess dress is a different uniform.</p>
				</article>
				<article>
					<p class="question">If a Cadet has too many ribbons to fit properly on the left side of his/her blue shirt, he/she may start placing ribbons on the right side over the nametag.</p>
					<p class="response">This is ENTIRELY FALSE. What an individual does if he/she has too many ribbons depends on the uniform being worn. If a Cadet is wearing a blue shirt without a service coat, a maximum of three ribbons may be worn on any row. I was incorrect about this when I said they could wear four to a row, because I said it as a blanket statement for all uniforms (I was wrong, I suck). For blue shirts, Cadets wear all or none of their ribbons. You'll find this in CAPM 39-1, pages 21 and 27, Note 4. So, if a Cadet has too many ribbons to place on his/her shirt, the cadet MUST forgo wearing his/her ribbons.If a Cadet is wearing the service coat, he/she may wear 3 or 4 ribbons to a row, which should enable the Cadet to wear all his/her ribbons. You'll find this in CAPM 39-1, pages 17 and 25, Note 4.</p>

					<p class="question">MREs contain laxatives in some form, whether it is in the chewing gum or by eating only a certain portion of the entire meal.</p>
					<p class="response">an Urban Legend even in the military. While MREs may well disagree with some people's digestive systems, there are no laxatives contained in them.</p>					
				</article>
				<article>
					<p class="question">When Cadets raise their hands to ask a question or respond to an instructor's question, they MUST raise their clenched fist and hold their forearm vertically while the upper arm is parallel to the ground.</p>
					<p class="response">I believe this is an Urban Legend as I can find no reference to this. Once again, it is permissible for a unit to require this at the unit level if they wish, but I can find nothing that mandates it. Personally, I would prefer they raise their hands HIGH, since some of them are shorter than others and if they hold their upper arms parallel to the ground and their forearms perpendicular and with fists clenched, they can be hard to spot.</p>
				</article>
				<article>
					<p class="question">Cadets must ask permission to ask a question.</p>
					<p class="response">While Cadets should be taught to be polite, and may need ask to see if a Senior Member or Cadet leader has time to answer a particularly detailed question, there is nothing that mandates a Cadet asking permission to ask a question. By the very nature of asking for permission, the Cadet has just asked a question. So if Cadets are required to ask permission before asking a question, a Cadet asking for permission has just ASKED A QUESTION WITHOUT PERMISSION! See where I'm going? So, rather than asking for permission to ask a question, just ASK the question.</p>					
				</article>

					<p class="question">Cadets must begin and end all statements to a senior Cadet or Senior Member with &quot;Sir,&quot; &quot;Ma'am,&quot; &quot;Chief,&quot; or &quot;Sergeant,&quot; as appropriate to grade and gender.</p>
					<p class="response">This is an Urban Legend. This is referred to as a &quot;Ma'am&quot; or a &quot;Sir&quot; sandwich � the notion that the first and last words out of a Cadet's mouth MUST be Sir or Ma'am (or Chief or Sergeant). For example,	&quot;Sir the answer to your question is 100 to 120 steps per minute, Sir!&quot; While using &quot;Sir,&quot; &quot;Ma'am,&quot; &quot;Chief,&quot; or &quot;Sergeant&quot; at the beginning OR end of statements to superiors is �highly encouraged,&quot; doing both is straight from the &quot;Department of Redundancy Department.&quot; There's nothing that mandates this and besides, it's silly -- just answer the question.</p>

					<p class="question">When in a group (but not a formation), if an officer senior to everyone approaches the group, the senior person present in the group salutes for everyone.</p>
					<p class="response">This is an Urban Legend. In this situation, (a gaggle), everyone salutes. As a rule, unless part of a formation everyone who is supposed to salute, <em>must</em> salute.</p>
				</article>
				<article>
					<p class="question">You're a lieutenant and in a gaggle with two majors and two master sergeants. A captain approaches. The approaching captain must salute the majors, but you and the NCOs do not salute the captain because you're with 2 officers who are senior to the captain.</p>
					<p class="response">This is an Urban Legend; essentially the same as number 9; you're in a 5 person gaggle and the Captain approaches. In this situation, the captain salutes the majors, and you and the master sergeants salute the captain. Again the rule; unless part of a formation everyone who is supposed to salute, <em>must</em> salute.</p>
				</article>
				<article>
					<p class="question">The U.S. Military (and by extension, CAP) salutes with the palm down because we've never lost a war.</p>
					<p class="response">This is totally false, though a complete, true and documented explanation may be impossible. Through at least the Spanish-American War (1898), U.S. Forces saluted with the palm exposed. I have found one plausible explanation for why we salute palm down, but explaining it means someone could take it as gospel and spread another Urban Legend. I have found evidence that U.S. forces (and CAP) salute with the palm down for the same reasons U.S. Navy sailors have the &quot;bibs&quot; on the back of certain uniforms. The bibs are a holdover from the days when sailors often wore their hair long and pulled it into &quot;tails&quot; in the back. They would often use various black substances to grease the tails. The bibs would protect the sailors' uniforms from getting stained, while the sailors' hands would become stained. The sailors began saluting palm down to hide their stained hands. PLEASE DO NOT TAKE THIS AS FACT! It's a story that makes sense and there is some evidence, but no rock-solid proof.</p>

					<p class="question">There is a <em>right side up</em> and <em>upside down</em> to ALL ribbons.</p>
					<p class="response">This is a situation where <em>it depends</em> is the answer. While some ribbons such as this: <img height="18px" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/65/CAP_Membership_Award.png/100px-CAP_Membership_Award.png"> can only go one way, others such as this: <img height="18px" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8e/Encamp_-_2.png"> can go either way. Those who tell you there is a &quot;weave pattern&quot; or other way to tell the &quot;top&quot; and &quot;bottom&quot; of the ribbon are wrong. There may indeed BE a weave pattern, but it does not designate the top and bottom of the ribbon.</p>

					<p class="question">If a unit has been awarded a unit citation, members who join that unit after the award date are authorized to wear the citation as long as they belong to that unit. However they must remove the citation if they transfer to another unit.</p>
					<p class="response">This is an Urban Legend. Only members belonging to a unit during the time frame covered by the award citation are authorized to wear the ribbons.&nbsp; CAP Regulation 39-3, Page 4, Paragraph 9. h. (2) states, &quot;The period of an outstanding achievement is normally short and characterized by definite beginning and ending dates.&quot; One page later, CAP Regulation 39-3, Page 5, Paragraph 12. c. (2) states, The Unit Citation Ribbon may be worn permanently by all individuals who were members of the unit during any portion of the period of time shown in the National Headquarters Personnel Action announcing the award.</p>

					<p class="question">When BDU sleeves are rolled up, the cuff of the rolled sleeve can't exceed the width of the sewn cuff or another pre-determined width.</p>
					<p class="response">This is an Urban Legend. CAP Manual 39-1, Table 2-3, line 1 states: &quot;Long sleeve camouflage pattern (woodland green) may be rolled up; if rolled up, sleeve material must match shirt and will touch or come within 1 inch of forearms when arm is bent at a 90-degree angle.&quot; Commanders <em>COULD</em> issue a local policy requiring the width of the cuff to be some specified distance, but we HIGHLY discourage that. Based on the different sizes of members, mandating a width could cause some members sleeves to be rolled too tightly and others to be so loose as to look sloppy.</p>
				</article>
				<article>
					<p class="question">A cadet awarded a &quot;Blue Beret&quot; through the National Blue Beret special activity can wear that beret at any time.</p>
					<p class="response">This is correct! Members may indeed wear berets with BDUs at any activity. Unfortunately, there is currently no official guidance in CAPM 39-1, supplements to that manual or national policy letters. The August 2006 National Board Minutes and occasional postings to the CAP Knowledge Base are the ONLY source of this information.</p>
				</article>
				<article>
					<p class="question">Only Cadet NCOs and officers may wear neck ties or tie tabs.</p>
					<p class="response">This is an Urban Legend. CAPM 39-1, Tables 2-1 and 2-3 place NO restrictions on who may wear neck ties or tie tabs.</p>
				</article>
				<article>
					<p class="question">Ribbons MUST be worn on light blue AF-Style shirts.</p>
					<p class="response">This is an Urban Legend. See CAPM 39-1, para 4-2 a. Ribbons are ONLY required on service dress or semi-formal uniforms; optional for other service uniforms.</p>
				</article>
				<article>
					<p class="question">If an officer or NCO is in command of a unit while performing drill and a new officer or NCO comes to take command that unit, the new leader must issue the command <em>At My Command</em> or <em>By My Command</em> before the unit can respond.</p>
					<p class="response">This is an Urban Legend. The command, <em>At My Command</em> is used when using a teaching technique called <em>Mass Commands.</em> For drilling a unit, a competent authority can take over command and there is no command he/she	must issue before troops respond. There is no such command as <em>By My Command</em> in AF Manual 36-2203. See AF Manual 36-2203, page 17, paragraph 2.6 and the sub-paragraphs for an explanation of how mass commands are used.</p>
				</article>
				<article>
					<p class="question">When issuing the command to call a unit to attention, the preparatory command is <em>Atten</em> or <em>Tench</em> and the command of execution is <em>HUT!</em></p>
					<p class="response">This is an Urban Legend. AFMAN 36-2203, page 11, paragraph 2.1.1 states, In this manual, the first letter of preparatory command is capitalized and printed in boldface (Squadron), and the command of execution is printed in all caps and boldface (ATTENTION).</p>	
				</article>
				<article>
					<p class="question">To command a unit to fall in, the preparatory command is <em>Squadron (Flight or Element)</em> and the command of execution is <em>Fall In</em></p>
					<p class="response">This is an Urban Legend. The command is simply <em>Fall In</em>. AFMAN 36-2203, page 12, paragraph 2.1.1.3 states, &quot;In certain commands, the preparatory command and the command of execution are combined, for example: FALL IN, AT	EASE, and REST.&quot; AFMAN 36-2203, Page 32, paragraph 4.3.1 states, &quot;A flight forms in at least two, but not more than four, elements in line formation (figure 4.1). The command is	FALL IN.&quot;</p>
				</article>
				<article>
					<p class="question">When taking an attendance report from element leaders, the person requesting the report (usually the flight sergeant) commands �REEEE-port!</p>
					<p class="response">This is an Urban Legend. The command is simply <em>REPORT</em>. AFMAN 36-2203, page 49, paragraph 5.3.4 states, &quot;The flight sergeants then command REPORT.&quot; In a LARGE formation (more than 4 full flights), it may be useful to draw out the command in order to be sure the sound travels to all members. In a squadron with one or two small flights, it's not likely to be needed.</p>
				</article>
				<article>
					<p class="question">When element leaders are giving their attendance report, they must execute a half left face or otherwise turn 45 degrees to face the flight sergeant, salute and give their report.</p>
					<p class="response">This is an Urban Legend. The element leaders stand and report in place. AFMAN 36-2203, Page 49, paragraph 5.3.4 states, &quot;Remaining in position, the element leaders in succession from front to rear of each flight salute and report �First Element all present� or �Second Element, 5 person(s) absent!&quot; Once again, in a LARGE formation it may be necessary to turn the heads in order to report, but it is not needed for squadrons the size we have in Wyoming.</p>
				</article>
				<article>
					<p class="question">When ordered to fall in, cadets will ALWAYS fall in at close interval.</p>
					<p class="response">This is an Urban Legend. The <em>ALWAYS</em> word should be a dead give-away, as few things are <em>always</em> or <em>never.</em> The default when falling into ranks is at NORMAL interval. AFMAN	36-2203, page 48, paragraph 5.3.1 states, &quot;On the command FALL IN, the squadron forms in two or more flights with normal interval between individuals (unless close interval is directed).&quot;</p>
				</article>
				<article>
				  <p class="question">When performing <em>Open Ranks</em> movements, the front elements take the required steps forward and the last element takes one step BACKWARDS.</P>
					<p class="response">This is an Urban Legend. AFMAN 36-2203, page 37, paragraph 4.5.1 states, &quot;On the command MARCH, the fourth rank stands fast and automatically executes dress right dress at normal interval. Each succeeding rank in front of the fourth rank takes the required numbered of paces.&quot;</p>
				</article>
				<article>
          <p class="question">When performing <em>Dress Right,</em> troops will extend their arms with their hand clenched into a fist.</p>
					<p class="response">This is an Urban Legend. AFMAN 36-2203 page 35, paragraph 4.4.1.1 states, On the command DRESS, everyone except the last airman in each element raises and extends the left arm laterally from the shoulder with snap so the arm is parallel with the ground. As the arm is raised, uncup the hand at approximately waist level, keeping the palm down. Extend and join the fingers and place the thumb along the forefinger. Note the red underlined verbiage above; Cadets often allow their arms to &quot;droop&quot; when performing Dress Right, Dress.</p>
				</article>
				<article>
					<p class="question">If an incorrect command is issued by an officer or NCO commanding troops for drill, members of the formation may say &quot;As you were sir/ma'am/chief/sergeant!&quot;; The commander may issue the command, &quot;As I was!&quot;</p>
					<p class="response">This is an Urban Legend. There are NO SUCH COMMANDS in AFMAN 36-2203. Page 12, paragraph 2.2.5 of that AFMAN states, &quot;Use the command AS YOU WERE to revoke a preparatory command. After the command of execution has been given and the movement has begun, give other appropriate commands to bring the element to the desired position. If a command is improperly given, the individuals execute the movement to the best of their ability.&quot;</p>
				</article>
				<article>
					<p class="question">If someone attempts to go between cadets they should raise their arms to prevent it.</p>
					<p class="response">This is an Urban Legend. There is no reference anywhere for this. Now, this doesn't mean it is ACCEPTABLE for unauthorized people to walk between people standing in formation.&nbsp; 
				The person in command of the troops should take necessary steps to get rid of the offending individual who is disrupting drill.</p>
				</article>
				<article>
					<p class="question">While riding in a car with a senior officer, junior officers/NCOs will remove their covers if the senior does, or leave their covers on if the senior leaves his/hers on.</p>
					<p class="response">I believe this is an Urban Legend, as I have not been able to find any official guidance in CAP or USAF publications stating this must happen.</p>
